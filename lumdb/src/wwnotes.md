# Will's notes

## this is not primetime stuff- I'm just learning

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app


npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

COMPONENTS
react.createclass is DEPRECATED
render is oblig


new is  
class App extends Component {
render()
}
class is reserved in js so within jsx we use className

## PROPS
It's common to create
const { text } = this.props;
to avoid having to do this.props repeatedly

## STATE 
state is an object
If you define state within a component it is only visible/available within same.
